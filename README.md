# New implementation!

CoNetinR is being implementend fully in [the seqgroup package](https://hallucigenia-sparsa.github.io/seqgroup/). Please check out the barebones implementation [here](https://hallucigenia-sparsa.github.io/seqgroup/reference/barebonesCoNet.html). The seqgroup implementation will receive more updates and improvements in the future. 

# CoNetinR

The CoNetinR package provides an R implementation of CoNet. Note that this implementation has less functions than the Cytoscape implementation; for example, p-value merging and ensemble edge calculation is not available. For more information on the original implementation, go [here](http://systemsbiology.vub.ac.be/conet). 

### Installation

To install the development version in R, use

```r
library(devtools)  
install_github("ramellose/CoNetinR")  
library(CoNetinR)  
```

### Tutorials

For a tour of CoNetinR, see the [overview vignette](https://ramellose.github.io/CoNetinR/articles/conet_tour.html).
